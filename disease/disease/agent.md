**Late Blight in Potato Farming in India**

**About Disease:**
Late blight is a fungal disease that causes black, water-soaked lesions on potato leaves and stems, leading to defoliation, reduced yield, and poor quality. It thrives in humid and cool conditions, affecting potato crops in India's temperate regions.

**Precaution:**
1. **Choose disease-free seed potatoes**: Select certified disease-free and late blight-resistant seed potatoes.
2. **Regularly inspect the crop**: Remove infected plants to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Prevention:**
1. **Rotate crops**: Rotate potato with non-host crops like wheat, barley, or oats to break the disease cycle.
2. **Use resistant varieties**: Plant late blight-resistant potato varieties like 'Kufri Surya' or 'Kufri Jyoti'.
3. **Apply fungicides and manage irrigation**: Use fungicides like copper oxychloride or chlorothalonil, and avoid overhead irrigation to prevent the spread of the disease.
